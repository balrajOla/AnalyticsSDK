/**
 This protocol should be implemented by every service that will be used with an instance of `Tracker`.
 To support specific features for analytics tracking, you can implement the following protocols next to `TrackerService`:
 - `TrackerEventAnalytics` to track events.
 - `TrackerTimedEventAnalytics` to track timed events.
 - `TrackerPushNotificationAnalytics` to track push notification and retrieve the push notification token.
 - `TrackerUserProfileAnalytics` to support identifying the user with some information.
 - `TrackerEventSuperPropertiesAnalytics` to support event super properties, properties that should be added to every (timed)event tracked.
 
 - important: `versionString` has to represent the version of the SDK used for the service or a self assigned version if an SDK is not used.
